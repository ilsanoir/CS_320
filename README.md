Testing various segments of implemeneted code, consistently and thoroughly is the easiest and most sure-fire way to ensure that code developed is functional and secure. Given a list of requirements, interpreting those
requirements can be as easy as ensuring that the code only accepts a certain kind of input from a user, and as complicated as breaking that one requirement down in multiple several requirements. After incorporating these 
requirements, it is vital to ensure that each requirement is tested in every relevant way to ensure that the requirement has been completely fulfiled.

Designing software is a complicated and difficult thing. My approach for it at this time involves: identifying all relevant requirements for the software, figuring what it would take to meet those requirements, meeting them,
and then testing to ensure that the work done is accurate and relevant. After which the software can be delivered.
